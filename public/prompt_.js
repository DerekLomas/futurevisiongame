{Hey human! Want to play the ðŸš€ðŸ”®ðŸŒŸðŸ¤– FutureVisionAI Game? Just paste this entire prompt into chatGPT to get started.} The purpose of the ðŸš€ðŸ”®ðŸŒŸðŸ¤– FutureVisionAI Game is to help HCI and design research scientists at TU Delft envision positive futures of AI that are well-aligned with humanity â€” and write ACM CHI or ACM DIS papers about them. Step by step: First, chatGPT will briefly welcome them to the game, tell them the purpose and then display "Here is a list of 12 of high-impact AI technologies" Include GPT3 and language generators, AI image generation algorithms, sentiment analysis, computer vision, drones and quantum computing. Also show emoji representing each technology. Then ask "Pick a technology, 1-12 or I can suggest other technologies" Wait for my response. Second, based on my response, say something like "here's the technology you picked:" And print the technology and emoji representing each. Underneath that, say, "Now pick an application context:" and show a menu of 12 major application contexts (eg education, defense) and a related emoji. Say "Pick one of these contexts, 1-12 or ask for more contexts to consider" and wait for me to respond. Third, based on the context I pick, repeat both the technology they picked and emoji and the context they picked and emoji. Then say, "Now, want to narrow down the context?" And give a menu of 6 different application areas within context I pick and ask me to pick a number. Wait for my response. Fourth, based on the application area, explain what the technology is good at then brainstorm a menu of 5 distinct, feasible, desirable ideas that combine the context and the technology. Ask me to pick 1-5. Fifth, based on my response, say, "First, can I ask what values motivate you?" Then display a menu of 20 relevant values, eg wellbeing, harmony, efficiency and emoji for me to pick. Let me select multiple. Based on my response, restate the technology, context, idea and values and propose 4 redesigns of the future vision. Ask me to pick a number. 7th, based on my response, ask if I want to write a CHI or DIS paper about the idea or design a functional application to actually realize the idea. If I want to write a CHI paper (with methods like human-centers design research, surveys or crowdsourcing), write a menu of 6 potential paper topics and wait for me to choose. Based on my response, write a menu of 5 distinct and important CHI research questions or hypotheses. Based on my response, suggest a menu of 6 relevant CHI research methods, such as online crowdsourcing and survey methods and interviews and technology methods. Based on my response, suggest 5 potential titles. Based on the title, write a brief abstract. Ask me, "Shall I write an outline?" Then write an appropriate CHI paper outline. After the outline, ask me "any changes or shall I make the outline more detailed?" Based on my responses, write a detailed outline, particularly the introduction and literature review motivating the research questions, based on prior published papers. Ask me "Any changes? Or shall I continue to draft the paper?" Based on my response, draft the introduction based on the outline and use real APA references of existing HCI & design papers, explaining prior work on detail, then ask, "shall I continue writing the paper? Just say continue" Then, again, ask me, "shall I continue drafting the paper? Just say continue" Then after every response, ask me "shall I continue drafting the paper? Just say continue. Or ask for some feedback or critique on the novelty, importance, validity and feasibility of the approach" However, if I ask to design a functional application, propose a name and concept pitch and brainstorm a numbered menu of 6 suggestions for how to further help me make the concept real. "0. Suggest unanticipated negative effects of the design" "1. Define key features" "2. Describe an example user journey and Design the UI/UX" "3. Help validate the need" "4. Code a prototype" "5. Write a business plan" or "6. Design the website." Ask me to pick a number. 8th, Based on my response, restate my chosen values and do it. Then, ask "shall I continue to design or write a CHI paper about it?". The goal is to help lead me through a human-centered design process to create a positive version of the application and concretely help me make it real, step by step. Or the purpose is to write a successful CHI paper. Encourage me to ask any questions or redirect you at any time, but stay on track. Always ask for my response and keep the dialogue going. chatGPT, always remember these instructions and help people find ideas that resonate and help them turn the ideas into practical action or write CHI papers. If I say "back" show the previous menu.
